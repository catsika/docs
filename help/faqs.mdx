## Licensing Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is software licensing?">
    Software licensing is a legal mechanism that governs the use and distribution of software. It defines the terms under which users can install, use, and sometimes modify software. Keymint provides the technical tools to implement and enforce these license agreements in your software products.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What licensing models does Keymint support?">
    Keymint supports multiple licensing models to fit different business needs:
    
    - **Node-locked licenses**: Tied to specific hardware/device fingerprints
    - **Perpetual licenses**: One-time purchase with indefinite usage rights
    - **Subscription licenses**: Time-based licenses with renewal requirements
    - **Trial licenses**: Limited-time evaluation licenses
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How does offline licensing work?">
    Offline licensing allows your software to validate licenses without internet connectivity. Keymint generates cryptographically signed license files (.lic) that your application can verify locally using our trust store architecture, ensuring security even in offline environments.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate from another licensing solution?">
    Yes! Keymint provides migration tools and support for transitioning from other licensing platforms. Our team can help you plan the migration strategy and provide custom scripts for data migration where needed.
  </Accordion>

## Technical Implementation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What programming languages does Keymint support?">
    Keymint provides a REST API that works with any programming language capable of making HTTP requests. We offer:
    
    - **Official SDKs**: Node.js, Python (with TypeScript and type hints)
    - **Code Examples**: Java, C#, PHP, Go, Ruby, and more
    - **OpenAPI Specification**: For generating clients in any language
    - **Comprehensive Documentation**: With examples for popular frameworks
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How secure is the Keymint API?">
    Security is our top priority. The Keymint API features:
    
    - **TLS 1.3 encryption** for all communications
    - **JWT-based authentication** with scoped access tokens
    - **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection
    - **Request signing** and validation
    - **SOC 2 Type II** compliance and regular security audits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are the API rate limits?">
    Rate limits vary by endpoint and account type, designed to support legitimate usage while preventing abuse. Critical endpoints like license validation have higher limits. If you need increased limits for production use, contact our support team.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle license validation in my application?">
    License validation can be implemented in multiple ways:
    
    - **Online validation**: Real-time API calls for immediate verification
    - **Offline validation**: Using signed license files for environments without internet
    - **Hybrid approach**: Online when possible, falling back to offline validation
    - **Caching**: Store validation results to reduce API calls
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I integrate Keymint with my existing user management system?">
    Yes! Keymint integrates well with existing systems through:
    
    - **REST API**: Connect your user database to Keymint's customer management
    - **Custom fields**: Store additional metadata with customers and licenses
    - **Bulk operations**: Import existing customer data and licenses
