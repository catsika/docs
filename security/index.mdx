## Security Measures

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Encryption">
    ### Encryption in Transit
    - All communication uses **HTTPS (TLS 1.3)** encryption
    - SSL certificates with 256-bit encryption
    - Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) support
    
    ### Encryption at Rest
    - Database encryption using **AES-256** encryption
    - Encrypted backups and snapshots
    - Secure key management with rotation policies
    
    ### Password Security
    - Hashing with salt rounds
    - No plaintext password storage
    - Secure password reset flows
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Access Control">
    ### Authentication
    - **Multi-factor authentication** support
    - Email verification for account changes
    - Device fingerprinting for anomaly detection
    - IP-based access monitoring
    
    ### Authorization
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
    - Principle of least privilege
    - API key scoping and permissions
    - Time-limited access tokens
    
    ### API Security
    - **JWT-based authentication**
    - Rate limiting and DDoS protection
    - Request signing and validation
    - Secure API key generation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Infrastructure">
    ### Cloud Security
    - **AWS/Azure** secure cloud infrastructure
    - Network isolation and VPC security
    - Regular security audits and penetration testing
    - 24/7 monitoring and alerting
    
    ### Database Security
    - **Neon.tech** PostgreSQL with encryption
    - Automated backups with encryption
    - Network-level access restrictions
    - Query monitoring and logging
    
    ### Payment Security

### Platform & Operational Security

- Secure Hosting Infrastructure: Keymint leverages modern cloud infrastructure for hosting. Our primary application is hosted on Vercel, with our database securely managed by Neon.tech.
- Secure Development: We incorporate security considerations throughout our development lifecycle.
- Third-Party Vetting: We select third-party service providers (like Neon.tech for database hosting and PostHog for analytics) based on their security practices.
- Internal Security Assessments: We conduct regular internal security reviews and continuous monitoring for platform abuse.
- Data Backups: We perform regular backups of critical platform data to ensure availability and support recovery processes.

### International Data Transfers

- When data is transferred internationally (e.g., to servers or service providers in the US or EEA), we ensure appropriate safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are in place.

## Your Role in Security

- Use a strong, unique password.
- Keep your login credentials and API keys confidential.
- Notify us if you suspect unauthorized access.
- Use the Service responsibly and in accordance with our Acceptable Use policy.

## Third-Party Services

- Stripe: Secure processing of credit card payments.
- CoinPayments: Secure processing of cryptocurrency payments.
- Neon.tech: Secure database hosting and storage.
- Vercel: Application hosting and infrastructure.
- PostHog: Product analytics.

## Security Best Practices for Developers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure API Key Management">
    - Store API keys in environment variables, never in code
    - Use different keys for development, staging, and production
    - Rotate API keys regularly
    - Implement key scoping to limit permissions
    
    ```bash
    # Environment variables
    export KEYMINT_API_KEY="your-production-api-key"
    export KEYMINT_PRODUCT_ID="your-product-id"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement Secure License Validation">
    - Always validate licenses server-side when possible
    - Use HTTPS for all API communications
    - Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage
    - Cache validation results appropriately
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow Offline License Security">
    - Use trust stores for offline license verification
    - Implement proper key rotation strategies
    - Validate license signatures cryptographically
    - Protect against license tampering
  </Step>
</Steps>
