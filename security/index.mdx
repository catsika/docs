## Core Security Principles

Our approach to security is built on these fundamental principles:

1. Data Protection: Safeguarding the personal and licensing data you entrust to us.
2. Secure Infrastructure: Utilizing reliable technologies and partners to maintain a secure operational environment.
3. Transparency: Clearly communicating how we handle and protect your data.
4. Compliance: Adhering to relevant data protection regulations and best practices.

## Key Security Measures

### Data Encryption & Handling

- Encryption in Transit: All communication between your browser/client and the Keymint platform is encrypted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS).
- Password Security: User account passwords are securely stored using strong hashing algorithms. We never store plaintext passwords.
- Payment Security: We utilize trusted third-party payment processors (Stripe for card payments, CoinPayments for cryptocurrency). We do not store your full credit card details or private crypto wallet information on our servers.
- Database Security: We use secure database hosting solutions (like Neon.tech) designed with data protection in mind.

### Access Control

- Enhanced Authentication: In addition to secure password hashing, access attempts may involve verification via a code sent to your registered email address. We also utilize checks based on device information and IP address analysis to help detect and prevent potentially unauthorized activity.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Internal access to systems and data is restricted based on employee roles and responsibilities, following the principle of least privilege.
- API Key Security: Users are responsible for keeping their API keys secure. We recommend following best practices for API key management.

### Platform & Operational Security

- Secure Hosting Infrastructure: Keymint leverages modern cloud infrastructure for hosting. Our primary application is hosted on Vercel, with our database securely managed by Neon.tech.
- Secure Development: We incorporate security considerations throughout our development lifecycle.
- Third-Party Vetting: We select third-party service providers (like Neon.tech for database hosting and PostHog for analytics) based on their security practices.
- Internal Security Assessments: We conduct regular internal security reviews and continuous monitoring for platform abuse.
- Data Backups: We perform regular backups of critical platform data to ensure availability and support recovery processes.

### International Data Transfers

- When data is transferred internationally (e.g., to servers or service providers in the US or EEA), we ensure appropriate safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are in place.

## Your Role in Security

- Use a strong, unique password.
- Keep your login credentials and API keys confidential.
- Notify us if you suspect unauthorized access.
- Use the Service responsibly and in accordance with our Acceptable Use policy.

## Third-Party Services

- Stripe: Secure processing of credit card payments.
- CoinPayments: Secure processing of cryptocurrency payments.
- Neon.tech: Secure database hosting and storage.
- Vercel: Application hosting and infrastructure.
- PostHog: Product analytics.
