## Additional Notes

- Some error codes (like 1 and 2) are reused across different HTTP statuses.
- The HTTP status code provides the primary classification (e.g., Bad Request, Unauthorized).
- The message field offers specific details about the error.

### Rate Limiting (429)

Implement robust retry logic, preferably with exponential backoff, when encountering this status.

### Server Errors (500)

These usually indicate a problem beyond the client's control. Log the error and notify support if the issue persists.

### code Field

This custom code provides a secondary level of detail, differentiating between types of errors within the same HTTP status (e.g., 404 with code: 1 vs code: 2).
