Access Tokens must be sent as a Bearer token in the Authorization header for every API request.
</Callout>

## Access Tokens

Access Tokens are unique strings required for authentication. Include them as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of every API request.

### Obtaining an Access Token

1. Log in to your Keymint Dashboard.
2. Navigate to Developer.
3. Generate a token and set its scopes.

### Using the Access Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests.

```http
GET /activate-key HTTP/1.1
Host: api.keymint.dev
Authorization: Bearer at_your_token_here
```

### Scopes

Scopes help restrict token permissions for better security and organization:

- Product scopes: Limit tokens to specific products.

## Security Best Practices

- Keep tokens secret and store them securely.
- Use HTTPS for all API requests.
- Generate tokens with the minimal required scopes.
- Revoke compromised tokens immediately.

## Token Management

Manage your tokens directly in the Keymint Dashboard:

- Generate new tokens as needed.
- Revoke existing tokens to maintain security.
