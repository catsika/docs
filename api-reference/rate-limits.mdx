Rate limiting helps ensure fair usage and protects against abuse while maintaining optimal API performance for all users.

## How Rate Limiting Works

  <Card title="IP-Based Limits" icon="location-dot">
    Limits are applied per source IP address to prevent abuse from specific locations.

### Rate Limiting Factors

Rate limits are calculated based on:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Source IP Address">
    The originating IP address of the request. This helps prevent abuse from specific sources while allowing legitimate distributed usage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="API Access Token">
    Each authenticated token has its own rate limit allocation, ensuring fair usage across different applications and users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specific Resources">
    Critical endpoints such as License Key validation and activation have additional protective limits to maintain system integrity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

The exact limits are not published and may change over time. They are designed to support legitimate application use while preventing abuse, such as brute-force attacks or excessive polling.
</Callout>

## Rate Limit Exceeded Response

When you exceed the rate limit, the API responds with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="HTTP Response">
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    Content-Type: application/json
    Retry-After: 60
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="JSON Response">
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Too many activation attempts. Please try again later.",
      "code": 3
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The message may vary depending on the endpoint.

## Handling 429 Too Many Requests

1. Do Not Retry Immediately: Avoid sending repeated requests immediately after receiving a 429.
2. Implement Exponential Backoff:
   - Wait for a short period (e.g., 1 second) before retrying.
   - If the request fails again, double the wait time (e.g., 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, etc.).
   - Continue this pattern up to a reasonable maximum delay.
3. Review Your Request Patterns: Persistent 429 errors may indicate overly frequent calls. Optimize your integration to reduce unnecessary requests.

If you consistently encounter rate limits during normal operation, contact support to discuss your use case.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement Exponential Backoff">
    When you receive a 429 response, wait progressively longer between retries (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s).
    
    ```javascript
    async function retryWithBackoff(apiCall, maxRetries = 3) {
      for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        try {
          return await apiCall();
        } catch (error) {
          if (error.status === 429 && i < maxRetries - 1) {
            const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
            continue;
          }
          throw error;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Cache API Responses">
    Reduce API calls by caching responses when appropriate, especially for license validation results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use Batch Operations">
    Where available, use batch endpoints to reduce the total number of API calls required.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Rate Limit Headers">
    Check for rate limit headers in responses to proactively adjust your request frequency.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Avoid polling endpoints unnecessarily. Implement webhook handlers where possible to receive real-time updates instead of frequent polling.
</Warning>

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a smoother experience while using the Keymint API.
