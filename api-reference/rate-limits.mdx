## How It Works

Rate limits are applied based on several factors, including:

- Source IP Address: The originating IP of the request.
- API Access Token: The token used to authenticate the request.
- Specific Resources: Certain endpoints, such as License Key validation, may have additional limits.

The exact limits are not published and may change over time. They are designed to support legitimate application use while preventing abuse, such as brute-force attacks or excessive polling.

## Exceeding the Limit

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will respond with:

- HTTP Status Code: 429 Too Many Requests
- Response Body: A JSON object, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Too many activation attempts. Please try again later.",
  "code": 3
}
```

The message may vary depending on the endpoint.

## Handling 429 Too Many Requests

1. Do Not Retry Immediately: Avoid sending repeated requests immediately after receiving a 429.
2. Implement Exponential Backoff:
   - Wait for a short period (e.g., 1 second) before retrying.
   - If the request fails again, double the wait time (e.g., 2 seconds, then 4 seconds, etc.).
   - Continue this pattern up to a reasonable maximum delay.
3. Review Your Request Patterns: Persistent 429 errors may indicate overly frequent calls. Optimize your integration to reduce unnecessary requests.

If you consistently encounter rate limits during normal operation, contact support to discuss your use case.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure a smoother experience while using the Keymint API.
