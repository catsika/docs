The Keymint API provides a comprehensive RESTful interface for managing software licenses, customers, and activations. This guide covers the essential concepts and patterns you'll need to integrate Keymint into your software.

## Base URL

All API requests use this base URL:

```
https://api.keymint.dev
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your access token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X GET https://api.keymint.dev/customer \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  ```
  
  ```javascript Node.js
  const response = await fetch('https://api.keymint.dev/customer', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  ```
  
  ```python Python
  import requests
  
  headers = {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
  
  response = requests.get('https://api.keymint.dev/customer', headers=headers)
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Keep your access token secure. Never expose it in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

## Request & Response Format

### Request Format
- All requests use JSON format for request bodies
- Include `Content-Type: application/json` header for POST/PUT requests
- Use proper HTTP methods: GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)

### Response Format
All API responses follow a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "action": "getCustomers",
  "status": true,
  "data": [...],
  "code": 0
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK` - Request succeeded
- `400 Bad Request` - Invalid request parameters
- `401 Unauthorized` - Invalid or missing access token
- `403 Forbidden` - Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found` - Resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests` - Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Server error

## Core Concepts

Understanding these key concepts will help you work effectively with the Keymint API:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Products" icon="box">
    **Product ID**: Unique identifier for your software or service being licensed. Each product can have multiple license keys.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customers" icon="users">
    **Customer**: End users or organizations who purchase and use your licenses. Customers can have multiple license keys.
  </Card>
  <Card title="License Keys" icon="key">
    **License Key**: Unique alphanumeric string that grants usage rights to your software. Can be activated on devices.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activations" icon="circle-check">
    **Activation**: Links a license key to a specific device using a Host ID. Tracks where licenses are being used.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Relationships
- One **Product** can have many **License Keys**
- One **Customer** can own multiple **License Keys**
- One **License Key** can have multiple **Activations** (up to the limit)
- Each **Activation** is tied to a unique device **Host ID**

## Common Workflows

### Creating a Complete License Setup

1. **Create Customer** → Get `customerId`
2. **Create License Key** using `productId` and `customerId` → Get `licenseKey`
3. **Activate License** using `licenseKey` and `hostId`
4. **Verify License** as needed in your application

### Managing License Lifecycle

1. **Check License Status** - Verify if license is valid and active
2. **Block/Unblock Licenses** - Control access for refunds or violations
3. **Deactivate Devices** - Free up activation slots when devices change
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track activations and customer activity

## Error Handling

The API returns detailed error information to help you handle different scenarios:

```json
{
  "message": "Activation limit reached",
  "code": 2
}
```

### Common Error Codes
- `0` - Success
- `1` - Validation error (invalid parameters)
- `2` - Activation limit reached
- `3` - License key not found or invalid
- `4` - Product not found
- `5` - Customer not found

<Tip>
Always implement proper error handling in your application to gracefully handle API errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
</Tip>

## Rate Limits

The Keymint API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Standard Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Pro Plan**: 5,000 requests per minute  
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits available

When you hit the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff to handle rate limiting gracefully.
