## Base URL

All API requests use the following base URL:

```
https://api.keymint.dev
```

## Authentication

Authenticate requests with your accessToken as a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Keep it secure and avoid exposing it in public repositories.

<CodeGroup>
  ```http Request example
  GET /activate-key HTTP/1.1
  Host: api.keymint.dev
  Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout type="tip">
See the Authentication guide for more details.
</Callout>

## Request & Response Format

- Use JSON for request bodies and responses.
- Include the Content-Type: application/json header for POST requests.
- Expect 2xx status codes for success and 4xx/5xx for errors.

## Key Concepts

- Product (productId): The software or service being licensed.
- License (licenseKey): A unique key granting usage rights.
- Activation (hostId): Tracks where a license is activated.
- Access Token (accessToken): Your secret credential for API requests.

## Error Handling

Failed requests return an HTTP status code and a JSON error response:

```json
{
  "code": 2,
  "message": "Activation limit reached"
}
```
